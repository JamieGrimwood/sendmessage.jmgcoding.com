  <h2>Send a message to my alexa...</h2>

  <p>
    Now I am gonna be honest. I am scared about this lol. I have no clue what
    you crazy people will send me but lets just give it a go. Please put your
    name at the end of the message so I can reply to it later on.
  </p>

  <p>
    I just want to point out that sending me any cuss words or anything rude
    will just not go through to my alexa, so please don't try.
  </p>

  <p>
    Amazon also has a 5 requests per minute thing, so don't go spamming it. You can check the previously sent messages by clicking on <a href="/messages.txt">here</a>
  </p>

  <%if(error === "nomessage"){%>
  <div class="isa_error">
    <i class="fa fa-times-circle"></i>
    You didn't actually put a message to send me...
  </div>
  <br />
  <% } else if (error === "nosender") { %>
  <div class="isa_error">
    <i class="fa fa-times-circle"></i>
    How am I gonna know who sent the message if you don't tell me? Just put your name in the sender box you silly billy.
  </div>
  <% } else if (error === "swear") { %>
  <div class="isa_error">
    <i class="fa fa-times-circle"></i>
    What did I tell you about no cussing ðŸ¤¦
  </div>
  <% } else if (error === "unknown") { %>
  <div class="isa_error">
    <i class="fa fa-times-circle"></i>
    Welp... This is awkward. An error has occured that I didn't think to put an error message for. Message me this has
    happened and ill fix it.
  </div>
  <% } else if (error === "toomanyrequests") { %>
  <div class="isa_error">
    <i class="fa fa-times-circle"></i>
    So um... Amazon only allowes me to send 5 requests to my alexa every 5 minutes so wait a bit and try again.

    (To put this in simple terms, mr suckerburg (amazon ceo man) only lets me send 5 messages to my alexa every 5 mins. blame him.)
  </div>
  <% } else if (error === "success") { %>
  <div class="isa_success">
    <i class="fa fa-check"></i>
    Welp. My alexa has recieved your (hopefully) lovely message and I will
    listen to it soon.
